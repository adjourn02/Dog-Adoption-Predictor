### Dog Adoption Predictor
Using a data set from Austin Animal Center (https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238/about_data), I will build a classifier to predict dog adoptions. I have already created a subset of the original data to minimize storage and to focus on attributes that I want to further analyze. To be specific, I'm interested to see if age and breed are relevant factors in making decisions leading to dog adoption.

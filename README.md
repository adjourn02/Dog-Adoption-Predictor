## Dog Adoption Predictor
Using a [dataset from Austin Animal Center](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238/about_data), I built a classifier to predict dog adoptions from this shelter. I created a subset of the original dataset which focuses on relevant attributes such as age and breed. These features will be used to model a Logistic Regression classifier which predicts adoption outcomes.
